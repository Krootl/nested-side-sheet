## 🕵️ Motivation

This repository contains a plugin that enables the display of multiple side sheets on top of each other with the ability to perform typical navigation actions like push, replace, pop and popUntil. We developed this plugin while building a web dashboard app and found that standard material navigation drawers and existing plugins couldn't provide us with the features we needed.

Our plugin is designed to be simple and flexible, allowing you to customize the look of your side sheets and transition animations without any limitations. With our plugin, you can create a seamless user experience that meets your specific requirements.

## ⚙ Features
* Display multiple side sheets on top of each other
* Perform typical navigation actions like `push`, `replace`, `pop` and `popUntil`
* Customize the look and feel of your side sheets
* Create seamless transition animations
